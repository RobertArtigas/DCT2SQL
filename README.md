# DCT2SQL
Clarion dictionary to SQL DDL back end templates.

This will take a clarion dictionary (DCT) and create SQL DDL for several back ends.

## The current SQL back ends can have DDL template generated code are: 
*POSTGRESQL, MYSQL, MSSQL, SQLANYWHERE, and MIMER.*

The dictionaries should be SQL ready to be generated correctly and there are a number of audit templates to help you check and correct your dictionary.

The templates have documentation built in that shows on the screen. Documentation is updated and improved on a regular basis. And since these templates only create output text files, they do not cause any changes to your existing systems and operations.
